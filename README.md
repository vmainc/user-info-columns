# User Info Columns Plugin

This WordPress plugin enhances the user list table in the admin dashboard by adding two custom columns: "Registration Date" and "Last Login Date." These columns provide administrators with important information about user activity and registration.

## Features

- **Registration Date Column**: Displays the date when each user registered.
- **Last Login Date Column**: Shows the date and time of the user's last login.
- **Sortable Columns**: Both columns are sortable, allowing administrators to easily organize users based on registration date or last login date.
- **Never Logged In Indicator**: Displays "Never" for users who have never logged in.
- **Automatic Last Login Tracking**: Automatically updates the last login date whenever a user logs in.

## Installation

### Manual Installation

1. Download the plugin files.
2. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/user-info-columns` directory.
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

### Using Code Snippets

1. Install and activate a code snippets plugin (e.g., "Code Snippets").
2. Add a new snippet and paste the plugin code into the snippet editor.
3. Save and activate the snippet.

## Usage

Once activated, the "Registration Date" and "Last Login Date" columns will appear in the user list table (`Users > All Users`) in the WordPress admin dashboard. These columns will display the registration date and the last login date for each user, providing a clearer overview of user activity and history.
